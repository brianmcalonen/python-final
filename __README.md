Final project for Programming Fundamentals I course (COSC-1336)

The steps required to accomplish this goal can be roughly described as follows:

* Input the data
* Validate the data
* Store the data
* Sort the data to facilitate efficient searches
* Search and filter the data to arrive at the correctly ordered subset of data you wish to examine
* Perform operations on the data such as summations of data items, counting data items, finding averages, min and max calculations, etc.
* Prepare reports of your findings
* Print your reports to the screen and to external files

I used the python-tabulate library to format the data reports.
To install the Python library and the command line utility, run:

pip install tabulate
